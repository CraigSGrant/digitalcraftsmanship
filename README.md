Digital Craftsmanship
====================
I took the html from the site manservants.co and after adjusting the white space and spacing of the document began to look at creating a semantic html document from the original code. The fact that it was built using bootstrap quickly created the issue of not getting in over my head for a simple one day project aimed specifically at learning to write using Jade.

Instead of renaming classes, removing id's, and changing every div into a more specific tags that could help the page be more readable I simply began converting the code. After all the reason for the project was to rebuild html using Jade and I feel much more comfortable now having done so. Hopefully this will be a good foundation for our project this next weekend building with Javascript dev accelerator students.
